# ðŸ“š Task: Library System with Classes

You're building a class-based system for a library.  
You need two types of items:

- `LibraryItem` â€“ the base class.
- `Book` â€“ a subclass that extends `LibraryItem`.

---

## âœ… Features Implemented

### ðŸ”¹ LibraryItem (Base Class)

- Stores a **private ID** and **title**.
- Uses a static `nextId` to auto-increment item IDs.
- Includes a static method `isLibraryItem(obj)` to check if an object is an instance of `LibraryItem`.

### ðŸ”¹ Book (Subclass)

- Inherits from `LibraryItem`.
- Adds private fields:
  - `#author` â€“ book's author.
  - `#isRead` â€“ read status (boolean).
- Increments a static counter `Book.count` for each created book.
- Methods:
  - `getAuthor()` â€“ returns the author's name.
  - `toggleReadStatus()` â€“ switches the value of `isRead`.
  - `isBookRead()` â€“ returns `"Read"` or `"Unread"`.
  - `describe()` â€“ logs a readable summary with emojis.
  - `Book.getBookCount()` â€“ static method to get total number of created books.
